[SVG Logo and Text Effects](https://www.dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-wordpress-plugin) (or SLATE for short) 
is a WordPress plugin by [dashed-slug](http://dashed-slug.net)
that helps you produce visually stunning text effects using
*[SVG shortcodes](https://www.dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-wordpress-plugin/svg-shortcodes-tutorial)*.

Use it to reinforce a brand identity, visually enhance your calls-to-action, or simply be more artistic,
with [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) text that you can edit at any time.
All this, without the need to resort to any image-editing software.

You can mix and match **fonts**, **colors**, **fill patterns**, and **filters**
to create unique text effects that draw attention to your content.


= easy SVG text =
Use **shortcodes** to insert fancy, eye catching, **editable** and **SEO-friendly** text into your posts, pages or custom content.

= fonts =
Out of the box, **SVG Logo and Title Effects** comes with **Google fonts** support. You may extend your font library with **font files** that you install yourself.

= fill patterns =
Letters are filled with a **fill pattern** of your choice. Fill patterns have parameters. Control various sizes, distances and colors to produce unique variations, or let the defaults work for you.

= filter effects =
Easily pass your SVG text through filter effects such as the built-in **glow** and **drop shadow** effects, or any other filter that you install via plugins.

= presets =
Save time and use **ready-made presets** to style your SVG text. Then you can tweak the text settings to your liking.

= extensible =
Download or create **plugins** that let you use additional fonts, vector shapes, filter effects, fill patterns, and presets.

= caching =
SVG text that has already been rendered once is subsequently loaded from a DB cache, for maximal performance. **No compromises on page load speed!**

= safe fallbacks =
Old browsers that don’t support SVG rendering will fallback to the closest HTML equivalent. **Your text will be displayed no matter what!**

= documentation =
Every release comes with **PDF documents** covering more than you will ever want to know about this plugin.

**To get the documentation, navigate to the [dashed-slug download area](https://www.dashed-slug.net/downloads/)
and make sure to get the *bundle* release.**

* **[More Shapes extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-extensions/more-shapes-extension/):**
  Extends the WordPress SLATE plugin to add more SVG shapes. Shapes are essentially SVG templates that allow more complex text effects.
* **[WPBakery Page Builder Integration extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-extensions/visual-composer-integration-extension/):**
  If you have **[WPBakery Page Builder](http://www.codecanyon.net/item/visual-composer-page-builder-for-wordpress/242431?ref=dashed-slug "This affiliate link supports the development of dashed-slug.net plugins. Thanks for clicking.")**
  from **wpbakery** installed, you can avoid writing shortcodes altogether. Tweak your SVG text via a friendly graphical interface when you install VC integration.
* **[Site & Page Titles Replacement extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-extensions/titles-replacement-extension/):**
  With most themes you will be able to easily apply SVG text effects to the **site title** or the **page/post titles** when you install this plugin.
* **[Raster Fallbacks extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-extensions/raster-fallbacks-extension/):**
  Don’t settle for HTML fallback in legacy browsers. When you install this plugin, your SVG text is automatically rendered to **cached PNG image fallbacks**. Fallbacks are shown whenever SVG cannot be rendered for any reason.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it work in all browsers? =

Most modern browsers have support for SVG.
For the ones that don't an HTML fallback of your text is displayed.
SVG compatibility is determined on the client-side via JavaScript.
If JavaScript is disabled and SVG is unavailable, an HTML fallback is displayed.

Visit the [dashed-slug](http://dashed-slug.net/svg-logo-and-text-effects-extensions/raster-fallbacks-extension/)
to get an extension that gives you raster (.png) fallbacks.

= Will it slow down my pages? =
